### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

layout and website design, structuring components correctly,the parent-child and sibling relation between elements in css, and the last but not the least best practices when writing css.
learned a new way to create space around components using padding.Also my first time venturing into jQuery,used jquery for dom-manipulation and changinf the color of the input field when an incorect email is entered.

I am deploying this application using netlify, and it is also my first time using netlify, so that is something i learned through this project.


### Continued development

The responsive design part of the website can be improved upon.
